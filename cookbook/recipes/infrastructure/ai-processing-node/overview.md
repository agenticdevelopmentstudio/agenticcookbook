An AI processing node is a long-running worker that continuously pulls AI jobs from the `adh` backend, executes each job through a registered handler, renews the job's server-side lease while working, and reports either a structured result or a retryable failure.

This recipe specifies **shared business logic only** — it is intentionally platform-agnostic. Two implementations satisfy it simultaneously: a Swift macOS daemon used as a development node, and a TypeScript service deployed as the production node. Neither implementation language appears in the requirements below; platform-specific guidance lives in [Platform Notes](#platform-notes).

**Scope:** this recipe covers the poll-claim loop, lease heartbeat, handler dispatch, result reporting, idempotency contract, and LLM backend selection. It does not cover job schema evolution, backend authentication/credential rotation, or the backend API itself.

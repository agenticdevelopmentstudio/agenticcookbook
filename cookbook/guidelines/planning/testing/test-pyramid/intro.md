# Test Pyramid

Projects SHOULD follow the Google SWE Book ratio: **80% unit / 15% integration / 5% E2E**.

- **Unit tests** — fast, isolated, test one behavior. The foundation.
- **Integration tests** — verify components work together. Use real databases, real
  file systems, real HTTP where practical. Slower but higher confidence.
- **E2E tests** — full system from user perspective. Expensive, brittle, SHOULD be used sparingly.
  Reserve for critical user journeys.

If you're unsure what kind of test to write, write a unit test. If the unit test can't
cover the behavior (e.g., database queries, UI rendering), escalate to integration.

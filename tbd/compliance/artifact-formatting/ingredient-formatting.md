# Ingredient Formatting Compliance

Ingredients are atomic component specs for UI elements, infrastructure patterns, and autonomous dev bots. They are the most structured artifact type — every ingredient follows a consistent section order so that agents and humans can navigate them predictably.

## Applicability

This category applies to any file with `type: ingredient` in its frontmatter. All files in `ingredients/` (and its subdirectories) MUST have this type, except `_template.md`.

## Section Order

Ingredients MUST follow this section order. Optional sections (marked MAY) can be omitted entirely but MUST NOT appear out of order.

1. YAML frontmatter
2. `# Title`
3. `## Overview`
4. `## Behavioral Requirements`
5. `## Appearance`
6. `## States`
7. `## Accessibility`
8. `## Conformance Test Vectors`
9. `## Edge Cases`
10. `## Configuration`
11. `## Deep Linking` (MAY omit)
12. `## Localization` (MAY omit)
13. `## Accessibility Options` (MAY omit)
14. `## Feature Flags` (MAY omit)
15. `## Analytics` (MAY omit)
16. `## Privacy` (MAY omit)
17. `## Logging`
18. `## Platform Notes`
19. `## Reference Implementations` (MAY omit in a cookbook with no code)
20. `## Design Decisions`
21. `## Compliance`
22. `## Change History`

## Checks

### if-frontmatter-complete

All required YAML frontmatter fields MUST be present per `introduction/conventions.md`.

**Applies when:** always.

**Required fields:** id, title, domain, type, version, status, language, created, modified, author, copyright, license, summary, platforms, tags, depends-on, related, references.

**Guidelines:**
- [Conventions](agenticdevelopercookbook://introduction/conventions)

---

### if-type-field

The `type` field MUST be `ingredient`.

**Applies when:** always.

---

### if-title-heading

The first H1 heading MUST match the frontmatter `title` field exactly.

**Applies when:** always.

---

### if-overview

The ingredient MUST have a `## Overview` section with a brief description of what the component is and when to use it.

**Applies when:** always.

---

### if-behavioral-requirements

The ingredient MUST have a `## Behavioral Requirements` section containing named requirements using RFC 2119 keywords. Requirements use kebab-case names in bold: `**must-do-something**: Component MUST ...`

**Applies when:** always.

**Guidelines:**
- [Conventions](agenticdevelopercookbook://introduction/conventions)

---

### if-appearance

The ingredient MUST have a `## Appearance` section defining visual properties: corner radius, padding, font, background, foreground, border, shadow, and size constraints.

**Applies when:** UI ingredients (components, panels, windows). MAY be omitted for infrastructure ingredients.

---

### if-states

The ingredient MUST have a `## States` section with a table defining visual state changes (default, pressed, disabled, focused, loading, etc.).

**Applies when:** UI ingredients with interactive states. MAY be omitted for infrastructure ingredients.

---

### if-accessibility

The ingredient MUST have a `## Accessibility` section defining: role/trait, label requirements, state change announcements, and minimum tap target size.

**Applies when:** always. Infrastructure ingredients define accessibility as "not applicable" with justification.

---

### if-test-vectors

The ingredient MUST have a `## Conformance Test Vectors` section with a table containing columns: ID, Requirements, Input, Expected. Each test vector maps to one or more named requirements from `## Behavioral Requirements`.

**Applies when:** always.

---

### if-edge-cases

The ingredient MUST have a `## Edge Cases` section describing boundary conditions, error states, and unexpected input scenarios.

**Applies when:** always.

---

### if-configuration

The ingredient MUST have a `## Configuration` section with a table listing configurable options: Option, Type, Default, Description. If the ingredient has no configurable options, the section MUST be present with a note stating "This ingredient has no configurable options."

**Applies when:** always.

---

### if-logging

The ingredient MUST have a `## Logging` section defining: subsystem, category, and a table of log events with columns: Event, Level, Message.

**Applies when:** always.

**Guidelines:**
- [Structured Logging](agenticdevelopercookbook://guidelines/implementing/observability/logging)

---

### if-platform-notes

The ingredient MUST have a `## Platform Notes` section with per-platform implementation guidance. At minimum: SwiftUI, Compose, React/Web.

**Applies when:** always. Single-platform ingredients list only the target platform.

---

### if-reference-implementations

The ingredient MUST have a `## Reference Implementations` section, directly after `## Platform Notes`, when its cookbook's repository implements it: a `| Platform | Path |` table with one row per implementing source file or directory. `Platform` is one of `web`, `apple`, `android`, `windows`, `python`; `Path` is a backticked path relative to the repository root, and a directory path ends with `/` and claims every source file below it. Every path MUST exist. In a cookbook with no code of its own the section MAY be omitted, or MAY be the one line `Not applicable: this cookbook carries no implementations.`

**Applies when:** the cookbook's `cookbook.json` declares `code` (a library or app cookbook that lives beside its source). `cookbook validate` checks that every listed path exists.

**Guidelines:**
- [Cookbook Formatting](agenticdevelopercookbook://compliance/artifact-formatting/cookbook-formatting)

---

### if-design-decisions

The ingredient MUST have a `## Design Decisions` section. Each decision follows the format: **Decision**: Description. **Rationale**: Why. **Approved**: yes | pending.

**Applies when:** always. New ingredients start with an empty section; decisions are added as they arise.

---

### if-compliance

The ingredient MUST have a `## Compliance` section with a table containing columns: Check, Status, Category. Status values: `passed`, `failed`, `partial`. Each check links to its definition in the relevant compliance category file.

**Applies when:** always.

**Guidelines:**
- [Compliance INDEX](agenticdevelopercookbook://compliance/INDEX)

---

### if-change-history

The file MUST end with a `## Change History` section containing a table with columns: Version, Date, Author, Summary.

**Applies when:** always.

**Guidelines:**
- [Conventions](agenticdevelopercookbook://introduction/conventions)

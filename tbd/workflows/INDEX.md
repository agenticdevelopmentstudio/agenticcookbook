# Workflow Index

Process-oriented recipes describing how Claude Code AI sessions should develop code in consuming projects. These workflows complement the [guide.* guidelines](~/.claude/guidelines/) by providing orchestration: *when* and *in what order* to apply those guidelines.

Cross-reference using `WF-` notation: "See WF-2" means code-planning.md. "See WF-2.3" means code-planning.md Phase 3. `WF-` numbers are stable — never reuse a number, even if a workflow is removed.

**Maintenance**: This index MUST be updated on the same branch as any workflow change. The CLAUDE.md `WF-` numbering table must stay in sync.

## Development Lifecycle

The five workflows form a pipeline. Every coding session flows through them in order:

```
WF-1 Branching Strategy (wraps all phases)
 ├── WF-2 Code Planning
 ├── WF-3 Code Implementation
 ├── WF-4 Code Verification
 └── WF-5 Code Review
```

WF-1 establishes the worktree and draft PR. WF-2 through WF-5 execute inside that worktree. When WF-5 passes, WF-1 marks the PR ready and merges.

## Shared Resources

|------|-------------|
| [_template.md](_template.md) | Starting point for new workflow specs — copy, don't edit |
| [guideline-checklist.md](guideline-checklist.md) | Shared opt-in/opt-out cross-reference for all guide.* guidelines |

# Guideline Applicability Checklist

version: 1.1.0
status: draft
created: 2026-03-27
last-updated: 2026-03-27

## Overview

A shared checklist of all guide.* guidelines that Claude Code MUST evaluate for applicability during a development session. Each workflow recipe (WF-1 through WF-5) references this checklist rather than duplicating it. When guidelines change, only this file needs updating.

During the **Code Planning** phase (WF-2), Claude Code MUST walk through this checklist with the user, asking them to opt in or opt out of each applicable concern. The decisions are recorded and carried forward through implementation (WF-3), verification (WF-4), and review (WF-5).

## Terminology

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| Opt-in default | The concern is assumed applicable unless the user explicitly opts out |
| Opt-out default | The concern is assumed not applicable unless the user explicitly opts in |
| Ask | Claude Code MUST ask the user — no default assumption |
| Always | The concern is always applicable and cannot be opted out of |

## Checklist

### Core Engineering (Always Apply)

These guidelines are always applicable. Claude Code MUST follow them without asking. They cannot be opted out of.

### Testing (Always Apply)

Testing guidelines are always applicable when writing code. The scope and depth may vary based on the task.

| File | Guideline | Summary | Workflow Phases |
|------|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| `../agenticdevelopercookbook/cookbook/guidelines/testing/testing.md` | Comprehensive unit testing | Prioritize unit tests, test state transitions and edge cases | WF-3, WF-4 |

| `../agenticdevelopercookbook/cookbook/guidelines/testing/unit-test-patterns.md` | Unit test patterns | Arrange-Act-Assert, one concept per test | WF-3 |
| `../agenticdevelopercookbook/cookbook/guidelines/testing/flaky-test-prevention.md` | Flaky test prevention | No shared state, no timing, no real network in unit tests | WF-3 |
| `../agenticdevelopercookbook/cookbook/guidelines/testing/test-data.md` | Test data | Builder pattern, no magic fixtures | WF-3 |
| `../agenticdevelopercookbook/cookbook/guidelines/testing/the-testing-workflow.md` | Testing workflow | Write tests alongside code, validate with mutation testing | WF-3, WF-4 |

### Opt-In Concerns (Ask the User)

These concerns apply to many but not all features. Claude Code MUST ask the user about each one during planning. The "Default" column indicates the starting assumption, but the user's answer overrides it.

| File | Guideline | Summary | Default | Prompt Template | Workflow Phases |
|------|-----------|---------|---------|-----------------|-----------------|
| `../agenticdevelopercookbook/cookbook/guidelines/ui/always-show-progress.md` | Show progress | Determinate or indeterminate progress for async work | Opt-in | "Does this feature involve async operations that need progress indication?" | WF-2, WF-3 |
| `../agenticdevelopercookbook/cookbook/guidelines/observability/logging.md` | Instrumented logging | Structured logging for all components and flows | Opt-in | "This feature will include structured logging. Any components that should be excluded?" | WF-2, WF-3, WF-4 |
| `../agenticdevelopercookbook/cookbook/guidelines/platform/deep-linking.md` | Deep linking | All significant views must be deep linkable | Ask | "Should the views in this feature be deep linkable?" | WF-2, WF-3 |
| `../agenticdevelopercookbook/cookbook/guidelines/platform/shortcuts-and-automation.md` | Scriptable/automatable | Components scriptable via platform mechanisms | Opt-out | "Does this feature need scripting/automation support (Shortcuts, intents)?" | WF-2, WF-3 |
| `../agenticdevelopercookbook/cookbook/guidelines/accessibility/accessibility.md` | Accessibility | Platform accessibility APIs from day one | Opt-in | "This feature will include full accessibility support. Any constraints?" | WF-2, WF-3, WF-4 |

| `../agenticdevelopercookbook/cookbook/guidelines/testing/property-based-testing.md` | Property-based testing | For parsers, serializers, data transformers | Ask | "Does this feature include data transformations that would benefit from property-based testing?" | WF-2, WF-3 |

## How to Use This Checklist

### During Code Planning (WF-2)

1. Claude Code reads this checklist
2. For each "Always" item: note it as applicable without asking
3. For each "Opt-in" item: inform the user it will be included, ask for confirmation or opt-out
4. For each "Opt-out" item: ask the user if they want to opt in
5. For each "Ask" item: ask the user the prompt template question
6. Record all decisions in the plan document

### During Code Implementation (WF-3)

1. Apply all "Always" items automatically
2. Apply all opted-in items from the planning phase
3. Skip all opted-out items
4. If a new concern surfaces during implementation, ask the user before proceeding

### During Code Verification (WF-4)

1. Verify all "Always" items are correctly implemented
2. Verify all opted-in items are correctly implemented
3. Confirm opted-out items were not accidentally included
4. Run applicable testing tools (mutation testing, security scanning) based on opt-in decisions

### During Code Review (WF-5)

1. Review against all applicable guidelines
2. Flag any opted-in items that appear missing or incomplete
3. Flag any guideline violations in "Always" items
